# Text Traders
This project is specifically designed for ardent readers who are willing to read new books without actually purchasing it. It gives the readers access to a wide variety of books which can be accessed by the users all over the world for FREE. We follow 3 B's policy that is Buy, Borrow and Barter.
- **Buy** - Users buy books for them to read
- **Borrow** - After they are done reading, they can exchange their books via our platform with any other book that is already listed on the site. They can contact the user and can mutually exchange their books and after reading can return the books as well.
- **Barter** - We are following the traditional barter system where no currency involved. This feature is more beneficial for academic purpose wherein students of higher classes can give their books to the lower classes students and thus following the cycle, they inturn will get their next year's books.

## Technologies we used
jQuery, Django, SQLite, JavaScript, CSS3, HTML5
